  <h1>üé® MultiModalHugs ‚Äî *Modality Matters Branch*</h1>
</div>

This branch of **MultimodalHugs** contains the scripts, configurations, and instructions to reproduce the experiments from the paper:  

> **"Modality Matters: Training and Tokenization Effects in Sign-to-Text Translation"**  
> *Accepted to SLTAT 2025*

The experiments explore the impact of input modality and tokenization strategies on sign language to text translation, using the [How2Sign](https://how2sign.github.io/) dataset.

---

## üìÑ Where to Start

We provide separate folders with scripts and configurations for each modality explored in the paper:

- `modality_matters_experiments/video_h2s`
- `modality_matters_experiments/poses_h2s`
- `modality_matters_experiments/features_h2s`

Additionally, the script `modality_matters_experiments/create_realigned_clips.py` allows you to generate the **realigned video clips** version of How2Sign used in our experiments.

For detailed instructions and guidance on replicating the experiments, please see:

üëâ [**modality_matters_experiments/README.md**](modality_matters_experiments/README.md)

This README provides:
- An overview of the dataset versions used
- Instructions for preparing realigned clips
- Pointers to each modality‚Äôs specific README for modality-specific details
